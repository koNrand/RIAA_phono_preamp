# RIAA compatible phono preamp

based on information from an [article](https://hifi.de/feature/technik-erklaert-phono-vorverstaerker-56652) from hifi.de I designed an phono preamp for my turn table.
The project contains an simulation of the equalizing circuit with an amplifier. 
In the KiCad project is 34x72mm PCB with rounded edges so the circuit fits in standard IP54 75x35x40mm cable boxes.
The final stereo circuit comes with with an adjustable amplification from 0dB to 60dB for both channel, and USB-A jack as power input and RCA jack inputs.

The `reichelt_special_components_list.csv` contains the most special component and a link to a public list, so you can order than from reichelt.de or look them up and order them whereever you want.

fair use only, open hardware FTW <3
